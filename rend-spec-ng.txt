                 Next-Generation Hidden Services in Tor
                         (DRAFT SPECIFICATION)
                          Draft 0, 2013-10-31


-1. Draft notes

   This document describes a proposed design and specification for
   hidden services in Tor version 0.2.5.x or later.  It's a replacement
   for the current rend-spec.txt, rewritten for clarity and for improved
   design.

   Look for the string "TODO" below: it describes gaps or uncertainties
   in the design.

0. Hidden services: overview and preliminaries.

   Hidden services aim to provide responder anonymity for bidirectional
   stream-based communication on the Tor network.  Unlike regular Tor
   connections, where the connection initiator receives anonymity but
   the responder does not, hidden services attempt to provide
   bidirectional anonymity.

   Other features include:

     * XXXX WRITEME

   Participants:

      Operator -- A person running a hidden service

      Host, "Server" -- The software run by the operator to provide a
         hidden service

      User -- A person contacting a hidden service.

      Client -- The Tor software running on the User's computer

      Hidden Service Directory (HSDir) -- A Tor node that hosts signed
        statements from hidden service hosts so that users can make
        contact with them.

      Introduction Point -- A Tor node that accepts connection requests
        for hidden services, and anonymously relays those requests to
        the hidden service.

      Rendezvous Point -- A Tor node to which clients and servers
        connect, which relays traffic between them.



0.1. Improvements over previous versions.

    XXXX writeme

0.2. Notation and vocabulary

   Unless specified otherwise, all multi-octet integers are big-endian.

   We write sequences of bytes in two ways:

     1. A sequence of two-digit hexadecimal values in square brackets,
        as in [AB AD 1D EA].

     2. A string of characters enclosed in quotes, as in "Hello". These
        characters in these string are encoded in their ascii
        representations; strings are NOT nul-terminated unless
        explicitly described as NUL terminated.

   We use the words "byte" and "octet" interchangeably.

   We use the vertical bar | to denote concatenation.

0.3. Cryptographic building blocks

   This specification uses the following cryptographic building blocks:

      * A stream cipher S(iv, k) where iv is a nonce of length S_IV_LEN
        bytes and k is a key of length S_KEY_LEN bytes.

      * A public key signature system SIGN_KEYGEN()->seckey, pubkey;
        SIGN_SIGN(seckey,msg)->sig; and SIGN_CHECK(sig, msg) -> { "OK",
        "BAD" }; where secret keys are of length SIGN_SECKEY_LEN bytes,
        public keys are of length SIGN_PUBKEY_LEN bytes, and signatures
        are of length SIGN_SIG_LEN bytes.

        This signature system must also support key blinding operations
        SIGN_BLIND_SECKEY(seckey, blind)->seckey2 and
        SIGN_BLIND_PUBKEY(pubkey, blind)->pubkey2 that meet the
        requirements discussed in appendix [KEYBLIND].

      * A public key agreement system "PK", providing
        PK_KEYGEN()->seckey, pubkey; PK_VALID(pubkey) -> {"OK", "BAD"};
        and PK_HANDHAKE(seckey, pubkey)->output; where secret keys are
        of length PK_SECKEY_LEN bytes, public keys are of length
        PK_PUBKEY_LEN bytes, and the handshake produces outputs of length
        PK_OUTPUT_LEN bytes.

      * A cryptographic hash function H(d), which should be preimage and
        collision resistant. It produces hashes of length HASH_LEN bytes.

      * A cryptographic message authentication code MAC(key,msg) that
        produces outputs of length MAC_LEN bytes.

      * A key derivation function KDF(input, personalization, n) that
        outputs n bytes.

   As a first pass, I suggest:

      * Instantiate S with AES128-CTR. [TODO: or ChaCha20?]

      * Instantiate SIGN with Ed25519 and the blinding protocol in
        [KEYBLIND].

      * Instantiate PK with Curve25519.

      * Instantiate H with SHA256. [TODO: really?]

      * Instantiate MAC with HMAC using H.

      * Instantiate KDF with HKDF using H.

   For legacy purposes, we specify compatibility with older versions of
   the Tor introduction point and rendezvous point protocols.  These
   used RSA1024, DH1024, AES128, and SHA1, as discussed in
   rend-spec.txt.  Except as noted, all RSA keys MUST have exponent
   values of 65537.

   As in [proposal 220], all signatures are generated not over
   strings themselves, but over those strings prefixed with a
   distinguishing value.


0.4. Protocol building blocks

   In sections below, we need to transmit the locations and identities
   of Tor nodes.  We do so in the format used by EXTEND2 cells in the
   Tor protocol:
         NSPEC      (Number of link specifiers)   [1 byte]
         NSPEC times:
           LSTYPE (Link specifier type)           [1 byte]
           LSLEN  (Link specifier length)         [1 byte]
           LSPEC  (Link specifier)                [LSLEN bytes]

   Link specifier types are as described in tor-spec.txt.  Every set of
   link specifiers MUST include at minimum specifiers of type [00]
   (TLS-over-TCP, IPv4) and [02] (legacy node identity).

   We also incorporate Tor's circuit extension handshakes, as used in
   CREATE2 and CREATED2 cells describe in tor-spec.txt.  In these
   handshakes, a client who knows a public key for a server sends a
   message, and receives a message from that server.  Once the exchange
   is done, the two parties have a shared set of forward-secure key
   material, and the client knows that nobody else shares that key
   material unless they control the secret key corresponding to the
   server's public key.

0.5. Assigned relay cell types

   These relay cell types are reserved for use in the hidden service
   protocol.

      32 -- RELAY_COMMAND_ESTABLISH_INTRO
      33 -- RELAY_COMMAND_ESTABLISH_RENDEZVOUS
      34 -- RELAY_COMMAND_INTRODUCE1
      35 -- RELAY_COMMAND_INTRODUCE2
      36 -- RELAY_COMMAND_RENDEZVOUS1
      37 -- RELAY_COMMAND_RENDEZVOUS2
      38 -- RELAY_COMMAND_INTRO_ESTABLISHED
      39 -- RELAY_COMMAND_RENDEZVOUS_ESTABLISHED
      40 -- RELAY_COMMAND_INTRODUCE_ACK

1. Protocol overview

   In this section, we outline the hidden service protocol.  This
   section omits some details in the name of simplicity; those are given
   more fully below, when we specify the protocol in more detail.

1.1. View from 10,000 feet

   A hidden service host prepares to offer a hidden service by choosing
   several Tor nodes to serve as its introduction points.  It builds
   circuits to those nodes, and tells them to forward introduction
   requests to it using those circuits.

   Once introduction points have been picked, the host builds a set of
   documents called "hidden service descriptors" (or just "descriptors"
   for short) and uploads them to a set of HSDir nodes.  These documents
   list the hidden service's current introduction points, and describe
   how to make contact with the hidden service.

   When a client wants to connect to a hidden service, it first chooses
   a Tor node at random to be its "rendezvous point", and builds a
   circuit to that rendezvous point.  If the does not have an up-to-date
   descriptor for the service, it contacts an appropriate HSDir and
   requests such a descriptor.

   The client then builds an anonymous circuit to one of the hidden
   service's introduction points listed in its descriptor, and gives the
   introduction point an introduction request to pass to the hidden
   service.  This introduction request includes the target rendezvous
   point, and the first part of a cryptographic handshake.

   Upon receiving the introduction request, the hidden service host
   makes an anonymous circuit to the rendezvous point, and completes the
   cryptographic handshake.  The rendezvous point connects the two
   circuits, and the cryptographic handshake gives the two parties a
   shared key, and prove to the client that it is indeed talking to the
   hidden service.

   Once the two circuits are joined, the client can send Tor RELAY cells
   to the server.  RELAY_BEGIN cells open streams to an external process
   or processes configured by the server; RELAY_DATA cells are used to
   communicate data on those streams, and so forth.

1.2. In more detail: naming hidden services

   Hidden services are named based on a long term public "identity key".
   This key is used to generate a special "onion address" usable by the
   Tor software. A public identity key K corresponds to the onion
   address "Enc(K).onion", where Enc is a base-32 encoding of K.

   Client software recognizes these addresses, extracts the keys, and
   and uses those to locate and authenticate hidden services.

   These keys are not used for direct signing operations.  See sections
   [IMD:AC] and [IMD:DIST] below.

1.3. In more detail: Access control [IMD:AC]

   Access control for a hidden service is imposed at multiple points
   through the process above.

   In order to download a descriptor, clients must know which blinded
   signing key used to sign it. (See the next section for more info on
   key blinding.)  This blinded signing key is derived from the
   service's public key, and, optionally, an additional secret that is
   not part of the hidden service's onion address.  The public key and
   this secret together constitute the service's "credential".

   To learn the introduction points, the clients must decrypt the body
   of the hidden service descriptor.  The encryption key for these is
   also derived from the service's credential.

   In order to make an introduction point send a request to the server,
   the client must know the introduction point, and know the service's
   per-introduction point authentication key in the hidden service
   descriptor.

   The final level of access control happens at the server itself, which
   may decide to respond or not respond to the client's request
   depending on the contents of the request.  The protocol is extensible
   at this point: at a minimum, the server requires that the client
   demonstrate knowledge the contents of the encrypted portion of the
   hidden service descriptor. The service may additionally require a
   user- or group-specific access token before it responds to requests.

1.4. In more detail: Distributing hidden service descriptors. [IMD:DIST]

   Periodically, hidden service descriptors become stored at different
   location, to prevent a single directory or small set of directories
   from becoming a good DoS target for removing a hidden service.

   For each period, the Tor directory authorities agree upon a
   collaboratively generated random value (See appendix [SHAREDRANDOM].)
   That value, combined with hidden service directories' public
   identity keys, determines their position in the hash ring for
   descriptors made in that period. [XXXX is this quite what I mean?]

   Each hidden service's descriptors placed into the ring in positions
   based on the key that was used to sign them.  Note that hidden
   service descriptors are not signed with the services' public keys
   directly.  Instead, we use a key-blinding system [KEYBLIND] to create
   a new key-of-the-day for each hidden service.  Any client that knows
   the hidden service's credential can derive these blinded signing keys
   for each given period, but without that credential it should be
   impossible to do so.

   The body of each descriptor is also encrypted with a key derived from
   the credential.

   To avoid a "thundering herd" problem where every service generates
   and uploads a new descriptor at the start of each period, each
   descriptor comes online at a time during the period that depends on
   its blinded signing key.  The keys for the last period remain valid
   until the new keys come online.

1.5. In more detail: Scaling to multiple hosts

   [THIS SECTION IS UNFINISHED]

   In order to allow multiple hosts to provide a single hidden service,
   I'm considering two options.

      * We can have each server build an introduction circuit to each
        introduction point, and have the introduction points responsible
        for round-robining between these circuits.  One service host is
        responsible for picking the introduction points and publishing
        the descriptors.

      * We can have servers choose their introduction points
        independently, and build circuits to them. One service host is
        responsible for combining these introduction points into a
        single descriptor.

   If we want to avoid having a single "master" host without which the
   whole service goes down (the "one service host" in the description
   above), we need a way to fail over from one host to another. We also
   need a way to coordinate between the hosts.  This is as yet
   undesigned.  Maybe it should use a hidden service?

   [TODO: Finalize this design.]

   [THIS SECTION IS UNFINISHED]

1.6. In more detail: Backward compatibility with older hidden service
      protocols

   This design is incompatible with the clients, server, and hsdir node
   protocols from older versions of the hidden service protocol as
   described in rend-spec.txt.  On the other hand, it is designed to
   enable the use of older Tor nodes as rendezvous points and
   introduction points.

1.7. In more detail: Offline operation

   In this design, a hidden service's secret identity key may be stored
   offline.  It's used only to generate blinded identity keys, which are
   used to sign descriptor signing keys.  In order to operate a hidden
   service, the operator can generate a number of descriptor signing
   keys and their certifications[SEE BELOW XXXXX], and their
   corresponding descriptor encryption keys, and export those to the
   hidden service hosts.

1.9. In more detail: A gallimaufry of keys

   [In the text below, an "encryption keypair" is roughly "a keypair can
   do Diffie-Hellman with" and a "signing keypair" is roughly "a keypair
   you can do ECDSA with."]

   Public/private keypairs defined in this document:

      Master (hidden service) identity key -- A master signing keypair used
        as the identity for a hidden service.  This key is not used on
        its own to sign anything; it is only used to generate blinded
        identity keys as described in [KEYBLIND] and [XXXX].

      Blinded identity key -- A keypair derived from the identity key,
        used to sign descriptor signing keys. Changes periodically for
        each service. Clients who know a 'credential' consisting of the
        service's public identity key and an optional secret can derive
        the public blinded identity key for a service.  This key is used
        as an index in the DHT-like structure of the directory system.

      Descriptor signing key -- A key used to sign hidden service
        descriptors.  This is signed by blinded identity keys. Unlike
        blinded identity keys and master identity keys, the secret part
        of this key must be stored online by hidden service hosts.

      Introduction point authentication key -- A short-term signing keypair
        used to identify a hidden service to given introduction point. A
        fresh keypair is made for each introduction point; these are used to
        sign the request that a hidden service host makes when establishing
        an introduction point, so that clients who know the public component
        of this key can get their introduction requests sent to the right
        service.  No keypair is ever used with more than one
        introduction point.

      Introduction point encryption key -- A short-term encryption keypair
        used when establishing connections via an introduction point. Plays a
        role analogous to Tor nodes' onion keys. A fresh keypair is made for
        each introduction point.

   Symmetric keys defined in this document:

      Descriptor encryption keys -- A symmetric encryption key used to
        encrypt the body of hidden service descriptors. Derived from the
        current period and the hidden service credential.

   Public/private keypairs defined elsewhere:

      Onion key -- Short-term encryption keypair

      (Node) identity key

   Symmetric keys defined elsewhere:

3. The introduction protocol

  The introduction protocol proceeds in three steps.

    First, a hidden service host builds an anonymous circuit to a
    Tor node and registers that circuit as an introduction point.

        [Between these steps, the hidden service publishes its
        introduction points and associated keys, and the client
        fetches them as described in section [HSDIR] above.]

    Second, a client builds an anonymous circuit to the introduction
    point, and sends an introduction request.

    Third, the introduction point relays the introduction request
    along the introduction circuit to the hidden service host, and
    acknowledges the introduction request to the client.

3.1. Registering an introduction point

3.1.1. Extensible ESTABLISH_INTRO protocol. [EST_INTRO]

  When a hidden service is establishing a new introduction point,
  it sends a ESTABLISH_INTRO cell with the following contents:

    SERVICE_KEY_TYPE [1 byte]
    SERVICE_KEY_LEN  [1 byte]
    SERVICE_KEY      [SERVICE_KEY_LEN bytes]
    FLAGS            [4 bytes]
    Any number of times:
       EXT_FIELD_TYPE [1 byte]
       EXT_FIELD_LEN  [1 byte]
       EXT_FIELD      [EXTRA_FIELD_LEN bytes]
    ZERO             [1 byte]
    HANDSHAKE_AUTH   [MAC_LEN bytes]
    SIGLEN           [1 byte]
    SIG              [SIGLEN bytes]

  The SERVICE_KEY_TYPE field indicates the type of the introduction
  point service key and the type of the MAC to use in for
  HANDSHAKE_AUTH. Recognized types are:
      [00, 01] -- Reserved for legacy introduction cells; see
                  [LEGACY_EST_INTRO below]
      [02] -- Ed25519; HMAC-SHA256.
      [FF] -- Reserved for maintenance messages on existing
              circuits; see MAINT_INTRO below.

  The SERVER_KEY_LEN field determines the length of the SERVICE_KEY
  field.  The SERVICE_KEY field contains the public introduction
  point authentication key.

  The FLAGS field contains the following (big-endian) flags.
  Unrecognized flags MUST be ignored.

      [XXXXX Define some flags or remove this field.]

  The EXT_FIELD_TYPE, EXT_FIELD_LEN, EXT_FIELD entries are reserved
  for future extensions to the introduction protocol. Extensions
  with unrecognized EXT_FIELD_TYPE values must be ignored.

  The ZERO field contains the byte zero; it marks the end of the
  extension fields.

  The HANDSHAKE_AUTH field contains the MAC of all earlier fields in
  the cell using as its key the shared per-circuit material ("KH")
  generated during the circuit extension protocol; see tor-spec.txt
  section 5.2, "Setting circuit keys".  It prevents replays of
  ESTABLISH_INTRO cells.

  SIGLEN is the length of the signature.

  SIG is a signature, using SERVER_KEY, of all contents of the cell,
  up to but not including SIG.  These contents are prefixed with the
  string "Tor establish-intro cell v1".

  Upon receiving an ESTABLISH_INTRO cell, a Tor node first decodes
  the key and the signature, and checks the signature.  The node
  must reject the ESTABLISH_INTRO cell and destroy the circuit in
  these cases:
       * If the key type is unrecognized
       * If the key is ill-formatted
       * If the signature is incorrect
       * If the HANDSHAKE_AUTH value is incorrect

       * If the circuit is already a rendezvous circuit.
       * If the circuit is already an introduction circuit.
       * If the key is already in use by another circuit.

  Otherwise, the node must associate the key with the circuit, for
  use later in INTRODUCE1 cells.

  [TODO: The above will work fine with, but it will do quite badly
  if we ever freak out and want to go back to RSA2048 or bigger.  Do
  we care?]

3.1.2. Registering an introduction point on a legacy Tor node [LEGACY_EST_INTRO]

  Tor nodes should also support an older version of the
  ESTABLISH_INTRO cell, first documented in rend-spec.txt.  New
  hidden service hosts must use this format when establishing
  introduction points at older Tor nodes that do not support the
  format above in [EST_INTRO].

  In this older protocol, an ESTABLISH_INTRO cell contains:

        KEY_LENGTH     [2 bytes]
        KEY            [KEY_LENGTH bytes]
        HANDSHAKE_AUTH [20 bytes]
        SIG            [variable, up to end of relay payload]

  The KEY_LENGTH variable determines the length of the KEY field.

  The KEY field is a ASN1-encoded RSA public key.

  The HANDSHAKE_AUTH field contains the SHA1 digest of (KH | "INTRODUCE").

  The SIG field contains an RSA signature, using PKCS1 padding, of
  all earlier fields.

  Note that since the relay payload itself may be no more than 498
  bytes long, the KEY_LENGTH field can never had a first byte other
  than [00] or [01].  These values are used to distinguish legacy
  ESTABLISH_INTRO cells from newer ones.

  Older versions of Tor always use a 1024-bit RSA key for these
  introduction authentication keys.

  Newer hidden services MAY use RSA keys up 1904 bits.  Any more
  than that will not fit in a RELAY cell payload.

3.1.3. Managing introduction circuits

  If the first byte of an ESTABLISH_INTRO cell is [ff], the cell's
  body contains an administrative command for the circuit.  The
  format of such a command is:

     Any number of times:
       SUBCOMMAND_TYPE [2 bytes]
       SUBCOMMAND_LEN  [2 bytes]
       SUBCOMMAND      [COMMAND_LEN bytes]

  Recognized SUBCOMMAND_TYPE values are:

       [00 01] -- update encryption keys

  Unrecognized SUBCOMMAND_TYPE values should be ignored.


3.1.3.1. Updating encryption keys (subcommand 0001) [UPDATE-KEYS-SUBCMD]

  Hidden service hosts send this subcommand to update the configured
  public encryption keys associated with this circuit. These keys
  are given in the form:
      NUMKEYS         [1 byte]
      NUMKEYS times:
        KEYTYPE         [1 byte]
        KEYLEN          [1 byte]
        KEY             [KEYLEN bytes]
      TIMESTAMP       [4 bytes]
      SIGLEN          [1 byte]
      SIGNATURE       [SIGLEN bytes.]

  The KEYTPE value [01] is for Curve25519 keys.

  The TIMESTAMP field is a monotonically increasing value across a
  given introduction point authentication key, but need not
  correspond to actual time.

  The SIGNATURE must be generated with the introduction point
  authentication key, and must cover all the entire subcommand body,
  prefixed with the string "Tor hidden service introduction
  encryption keys v1".

  [TODO: Nothing is done here to prove ownership of the encryption
  keys. Does that matter?]

  Setting the encryption keys for a given circuit replaces the
  previous keys for that circuit.

3.2. Sending an INTRODUCE1 cell to the introduction point.

  In order to participate in the introduction protocol, a client
  must know the following:

    * An introduction point for a service.
    * The introduction authentication key for that introduction point.
    * The introduction encryption key for that introduction point.

  The client sends an INTRODUCE1 cell to the introduction point,
  containing an identifier for the service, an identifier for the
  encryption key that the client intends to use, and an opaque blob
  to be relayed to the hidden service host.

  In reply, the introduction point sends an INTRODUCE_ACK cell back
  to the client, either informing it that its request has been
  delivered, or that its request will not succeed.

3.2.1. INTRODUCE1 cell format

  An INTRODUCE1 cell has the following contents:

     AUTH_KEYID      [32 bytes]
     ENC_KEYID       [8 bytes]
     Any number of times:
       EXT_FIELD_TYPE [1 byte]
       EXT_FIELD_LEN  [1 byte]
       EXT_FIELD      [EXTRA_FIELD_LEN bytes]
     ZERO             [1 byte]
     BLOB            [Up to end of relay payload]

  Upon receiving an INTRODUCE1 cell, the introduction point checks
  whether AUTH_KEYID and ENC_KEYID match a configured introduction
  point authentication key and introduction point encryption key.
  If they do, the cell is relayed; if not, it is not.

  The AUTH_KEYID for an Ed25519 public key is the public key itself.
  The ENC_KEYID for a Curve25519 public key is the first 8 bytes of
  the public key.  (This key ID is safe to truncate, since all the
  keys are generated by the hidden service host, and the ID is only
  valid relative to a single AUTH_KEYID.)

  To relay an INTRODUCE1 cell, the introduction point sends an
  INTRODUCE2 cell with exactly the same contents.

3.2.2. INTRODUCE_ACK cell format.

  An INTRODUCE_ACK cell has the following fields:
     STATUS    [2 bytes]
